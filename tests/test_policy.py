"""Offline contracts for the generic browsing policy text. No APIs, no browser.

The browsing policy is data: the model reads it as instructions for choosing one
operation and one target. These tests pin the clauses that stop the agent from
ending a search early, and assert the policy stays site-agnostic and value-free.
